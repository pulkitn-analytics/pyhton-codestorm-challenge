# Python Practice Programs

## Project Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Python programs developed
to strengthen core programming concepts, logical thinking, and object-oriented
design principles. The problems range from beginner to intermediate level and
cover topics commonly assessed in technical interviews and coding tests.

## Topics Covered
- Variables and Data Types
- Conditional Statements
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions
- String Manipulation
- Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries
- Exception Handling (try-except, custom exceptions)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
- Basic Algorithms and Logic Building
- Input/Output Operations

## Project Structure
- Programs are organized to focus on one concept at a time
- Code is written in a clean and readable manner
- Meaningful comments are added for clarity and understanding
- Both functional and object-oriented approaches are used where applicable

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of Python fundamentals,
object-oriented programming concepts, and exception handling. It helped improve
my problem-solving skills and ability to write structured, reusable, and
maintainable code.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
3. Run the cells sequentially to explore the programs and outputs
